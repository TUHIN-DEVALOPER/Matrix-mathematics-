## Introduction

Matrices are fundamental objects in mathematics, especially in linear algebra. They are widely used in computer science, physics, economics, engineering, and other fields. This repository aims to help both beginners and experts by providing a comprehensive set of tools to perform matrix operations such as multiplication, inversion, determinant calculation, and more.

## Features

- Matrix creation and initialization
- Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Transposition and inversion
- Determinant and rank calculation
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector computation
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Matrix decomposition (LU, QR, etc.)

## Installation

You can clone this repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/matrix-mathematics.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the zip file and extract it to your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy (for matrix computations)

You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

### Importing the Library

You can import the matrix module in your Python script as follows:

```python
from matrix import Matrix
```

### Example Operations

#### Creating a Matrix

```python
A = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(A)
```

#### Matrix Addition

```python
B = Matrix([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
C = A + B
print(C)
```

#### Matrix Multiplication

```python
D = A * B
print(D)
```

#### Matrix Inversion

```python
A_inv = A.inverse()
print(A_inv)
```

#### Determinant Calculation

```python
det_A = A.determinant()
print(f"Determinant: {det_A}")
```

#### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

```python
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = A.eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors()
print(f"Eigenvalues: {eigenvalues}")
print(f"Eigenvectors: {eigenvectors}")
```

## Matrix Operations

Here are some of the core operations you can perform with matrices:

- **Matrix Addition**: Add two matrices of the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Subtraction**: Subtract one matrix from another.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply two matrices (dot product).
- **Transpose**: Flip a matrix over its diagonal.
- **Inverse**: Find the inverse of a matrix (if it exists).
- **Determinant**: Calculate the determinant of a matrix.
- **Rank**: Find the rank of a matrix.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
